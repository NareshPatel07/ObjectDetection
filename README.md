# 🖼️ Object Detection with Deep Learning  

This repository contains my **Object Detection project notebook** developed as part of the **1Stop Training Program**.  
The notebook demonstrates how deep learning and computer vision techniques can be applied to detect and recognize objects in images.

## 📌 Contents  
- `Object_detection.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Preprocessing and preparing datasets  
- Data augmentation for better accuracy  
- Object detection using **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Visualization with **OpenCV**  
- Model evaluation with **Precision, Recall, and mAP**
